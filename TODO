- Better add + remove views

View
    update : does not remove from DOM, update part of the view html => events delegated are still active. no pb.
    render : potentially render from scratch or replace full view html (except the outer container) => events delegated are still active. no pb.
    remove: remove all view html (with the outer container) => all events should be dropped as well as model / collection events


We define render function for each view but we NEVER call render directly.
Instead, we call renderChild.
renderChild register the child view and call render for us.

!!!!!!!!!! Render MUST return a PROMISE (= DEFERRED) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

missing post render for renderChild with "how"
Write renderer with complex view management

each view is assciated with a renderTree
VIEW1 - renderTree 1
    VIEW2 - renderTree 1
        VIEW2.1 - renderTree 1
        VIEW2.2 - renderTree 1
        VIEW2.3 - renderTree 1
    VIEW3 - renderTree 1
    VIEW4 - renderTree 1

trees[1]
    rendered: false,
    fragment: document.createDocumentFragment()


- Better link between views and models with models onchange events
- use backbone.sync events instead of models callbacks


promise = promesse = deferred

p1 renderChild1
p2 renderChild2
p3 renderChild3
