We define render function for each view but we NEVER call render directly.
Instead, we call renderChild.
renderChild register the child view and call render for us.

!!!!!!!!!! Render MUST return a PROMISE (= DEFERRED) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

missing post render for renderChild with "how"
Write renderer with complex view management

- Better link between views and models with models onchange events
- use backbone.sync events instead of models callbacks
- fix change from "no extentions yet" to "1 extention". (data-msg / env?)

promise = promesse = deferred

p1 renderChild1
p2 renderChild2
p3 renderChild3
